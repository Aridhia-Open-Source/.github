## The Company
Aridhia helps clinical and life sciences pioneers in Research Hospitals, Universities, Pharmaceutical Companies & Global Medical Networks who want to advance their medical research and improve outcomes more quickly. We do this by providing a safe, secure Digital Research Environment (DRE).

## Our Commitment 
Our goal is to bring large-scale computing and analytics to healthcare and to bridge the gap between clinical research and how that knowledge contributes to day-to-day healthcare delivery. We created this open source organisation in that same spirit, reinforcing our commitment to a world with better health outcomes for all patients.
